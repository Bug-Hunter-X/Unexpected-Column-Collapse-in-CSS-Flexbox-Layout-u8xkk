The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in certain browsers. The intention is to create a two-column layout, but the second column collapses unexpectedly. 
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.column {
  flex: 1;
}

/* This should have a width */
.column:nth-child(2) {
  width: 300px;
}
```
